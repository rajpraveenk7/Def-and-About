Jenkins:

Jenkins is a open source automation server that helps the developers automake the process of build and test and deploying software

We have 2 fundamental practice
CI and CD, is software development practice
continuous integration: where code changes are automatically tested and merged into a shared repository frequently.
continuous deployment: where code changes are automatically deployed to production as soon as they pass automated testing. 

Jenkins is a open source automation server that helps the developers automake the process of build and test and deploying software

CI: after the developing the project or any version changes may applied in the project, we save it GitHub repository, when we set our repo urls to Jenkins 
it automatically process our code

CD: after the integration it automatically deploy in production, this Jenkins helps it automatically

in olden days we need manager/lead to integrate and deployment software, to make this process better we use Jenkins to auto CI and CD
integrate(means verify the code)
deployment(means to merge the code in production)


Jenkins is a popular open source automation tool which is used for continuous integration and continuous deployment processes.
Jenkins is a open source automation server that helps the developers automake the process of build and test and deploying software
OR
Jenkins is a powerful open-source automation server used primarily for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), it helps the developers automake the process of build and test and deploying software

-------------------------
open source automation server
in the process of software development life cycle we build, test, deploy
it is server based system
git and other version control it support
Jenkins is useful to create and implement through pipeline of ci and cd workflow 

process - 
software development:
build code
store in git
pull the code for unittest
after the test we deploy in production environment
to automate the whole process - we use Jenkins
