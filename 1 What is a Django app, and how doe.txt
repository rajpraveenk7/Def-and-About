1 What is a Django app, and how does it differ from a Django project? How do you organize your Django projects and apps?

Django Project: A collection of settings and configurations for your entire web application. It includes one or more Django apps and handles the overall configuration, including database settings and URL routing.

Django App: A self-contained module within a project that handles a specific aspect of your application, like user management or blog functionality. Each app can have its own models, views, templates, and static files.

Organization:

Project: Central place where you manage settings and URLs for the whole application.
Apps: Separate units within the project, each managing a specific part of the functionality.

2 Explain the purpose of Django’s urls.py file. How do you set up URL routing for views, and what are path converters?

The urls.py file in Django is used to route incoming web requests to the appropriate view functions or class-based views based on the URL pattern. It maps URLs to views, which then handle the request and return a response.

Setting up URL Routing:
Define URL patterns in urls.py using the path() function.
Each pattern maps a URL to a specific view function or class.

Pathconverter:
Path converters are used to capture values from the URL and pass them as arguments to the view. They are defined in the URL pattern.

3 What are Django’s views and how do they handle HTTP requests? Can you describe the difference between function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs)?

In Django, views are functions or classes that handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. They process the incoming request data, interact with the database if needed, and render a response (such as an HTML page) or return data (like JSON).

Handling HTTP Requests:

Views receive a request from the user.
They process the request (e.g., query the database, handle form submissions).
They return an HTTP response, which could be an HTML page, a redirect, or data.
Function-Based Views (FBVs):

Simple and straightforward functions that take a request object and return a response object.
They are good for simple or one-off views where logic is minimal.

Class-Based Views (CBVs):
More structured and reusable. They use classes to encapsulate view logic.
Provide built-in methods for common tasks (like rendering templates or handling forms) and support mixins for additional functionality.

Key Differences:
FBVs: Easier to write and understand for simple tasks.
CBVs: Offer more features and reusability for complex views, allowing you to organize code better and use built-in behaviors.

Built-in Methods: CBVs come with pre-defined methods for common tasks. For example, get() for handling GET requests and post() for handling POST requests. These methods can be overridden to customize behavior.
Mixins: CBVs support mixins, which are reusable components that can add specific functionality (like authentication or form handling) to views without needing to duplicate code.

4 How does Django’s admin interface work? What are some common customizations you can make to the admin interface?

Django’s admin interface provides a web-based tool for managing your data models. It automatically generates a CRUD interface for models you register with it.

How It Works:
Model Registration: Register models in admin.py using admin.site.register().
Admin Class: Customize the interface by creating a class inheriting from admin.ModelAdmin.
Admin Site: The admin interface is served at the /admin/ URL.
Common Customizations:
Field Display: Use list_display, search_fields, and list_filter to control which fields are shown and how.
Forms: Customize forms with the form attribute.
Inline Models: Use InlineModelAdmin classes to manage related models within the same page.
Custom Actions: Add custom bulk actions to perform operations on selected items.
Templates: Override default admin templates for custom styling.
