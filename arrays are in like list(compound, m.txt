arrays are in like list(compound, mutable and not heterogeneous)
as compared to list(very slow), but this array(very fast) for million, trillion of data
but it only it store the same datatype


numpy array is just like a list, but its more powerful.
numpy - Numeric Python.



math funtions
 

practice;
np1=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
np.shape(list1)

np2=arange(10)
print(np2)

np3=np.arange(0,10,2)
print(np3)

np4=np.zeros(10)
print(np4)

np5=np.zeros((2,10))
print(np5)
