high scalability for simple applications,
easy to build a quick prototype
routing url is easy
easy to develop and maintain applications
database integration is easy 
small core and easily extensible 
minimal yet powerful platform
lots or resources available online especially on GitHub 

disadvantages of flask
higher maintenance costs for more complex systems
complicated maintenance for large implementations.
async may be a little problem
lack of database and orm
setting up a large project requires some previous knowledge of framework
